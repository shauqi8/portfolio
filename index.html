            <h2>Technology Consulting That Solves Real-World Business Problems</h2>

                    <p>When you hire me, you're going to be working with me directly—from the beginning of our engagement until sign-off—and not with an offshored contractor. That means that you won't be explaining your problems to a salesperson who will try to convey the scope to his developers. Instead, we'll be working collaboratively to determine your most critical business needs and the bottlenecks that may be slowing you down.</p>
                    <p>I'm a pro, and when you hire me, you're hiring my depth of knowledge and experience. I've built a solid track record of delivering complex, mission-critical browser-based applications and solutions. With particularly a lot more working with small- to medium-sized clients who need a multi-faceted technologist who can deliver results across the enterprise—and rapidly solve a wide range of problems.</p>
                    <p>And since there's no middleman—no sales team doing the initial call—I can keep my overhead and rates reasonable, and deliver the most bang for the buck for my clients.</p>
